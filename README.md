## Hi, I'm Hanna MargrÃ©t ðŸ‘‹

I'm an MSc Computing (Software Engineering) student at Imperial College London, currently working on my individual project focused on open source software security.

I have a BSc in Software Engineering from the University of Iceland, and Iâ€™m especially interested in cybersecurity and building reliable software systems.
